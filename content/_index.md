## Welcome

In this workshop, you will learn how to build a working bot that can be deployed through voice or chat. This specific workshop will cover the native Genesys Dialog Engine Bot Flows. With Genesys Dialog Engine Bot Flows, you are able to build bots within Architect and integrate them into Architect call, chat, and message flows. This process unifies the bot and flow authoring experience for administrators, flow authors, and contact center managers. For more information, please visit our [Resource Center](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/about-architect-dialog-engine-bot-flows/)
